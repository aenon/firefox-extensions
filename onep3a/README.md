# 1P3A Extension

Firefox extension for viewing [1point3acres bbs](http://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/) normally.

## What does it do

This extension removes all the jammers from 11point3acres.com bbs posts so the user is able to copy and paste as they wish.

# Why?

The author of a post holds the copyright of that post. No one other than the author should decide what license the work is published under. This means:

* If the author choose to use a license that does not allow derivative works, it is illegal for the website to create derivative work (a copy with hidden jammers) based on the original post

* If the author choose to use a license that allows derivative works, it is illegal for the website to prevent anyone else from copying the original content of the work.
